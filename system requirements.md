Autograd \
Note that we modified the function gradmask within autograd to be able to learn only a subset of parameters. We provide the modified autograd function in the folder utils.

The packages used to fit the models are currently outdated, e.g. autograd is now integrated within PyTorch. However, the scripts should be easily adapted to run in modern platforms.
